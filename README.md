# Shoot the Enemy!

Shoot the Enemy! drops the player onto a low poly, stylised straight‑line battlefield where they command a squad of soldiers against waves of generated foes. The focus is simple, soothing gameplay that anybody could play! The basic mechanics of the game should be kept simple: shoot the enmies coming at you, upgrade(or downgrade!) your team when obstactles/rewards come your way. Levels should be easy and short (2-3 minutes).

Though the base of the game is to be kept entirely simple and soothing, that does not mean we will cheap out on various additions to the game. The player spawns inside of a lobby where they can pick between different worlds to play levels inside of. Each world will have it's own themes or specific challenges. The player can choose a cosmetic skin for their team when joining a level. Players can also choose an operator, a centralized larger soldier on their team, that has a special ability or trait that could apply to the whole team. At the end of a level a 'boss' spawns. Two styles of multiplayer: 1) Arena mode where 6-8 players see who can last the longest 2) Duel mode where two players see who performs the best.

## Core gameplay loop

- Players choose a level from various worlds
- Control your squad from left to right as endless waves and enemies approach you
- Collect rewards and upgrade your team over time inside a level

## Core tools / build direction

- Modular Architecture – Clean Luau modules, single‑responsibility.
- Using ROJO / VSCODE to stray away from ROBLOX STUDIO

## Art Direction

The game adopts a low‑poly minimalist aesthetic that is easy on performance and instantly readable, yet unafraid to drop a more intricate build when it adds wow‑factor. Simple shapes, bold colours, and clean silhouettes keep the action clear and satisfying.
